## How does it work ? 
ReCore Politics is a so-called "light" algorithm, meaning that it does not require multiple energy-intensive servers to operate, but can work very well locally. This reduces the complexity of the calculations while maintaining a reliable and rich content recommendation while maintaining control.

The fundamental operation of this algorithm relies on a straightforward calculation : assigning one or more "identifiers" to a user's content. This means the algorithm will determine the user's various opinions and associate each opinion with a specific predefined identifier. Consequently, it will be able to suggest relevant content to the user at an adaptable frequency, thereby reaching a new target audience. ReCore has its own set of predefined identifiers, but it is also possible to create new ones.


## How does ReCore politics define the opinions to be defined by its algorithm?
We simply trace all political trends and all their deviations in order to define them in our algorithm. Owners are free to modify or adapt them.

Classified as such because it can be used on platforms with many users and, although more environmentally friendly than a normal algorithm, it still pollutes a little.
